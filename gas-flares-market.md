<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Gas Flares Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Enclosed Flare</li><li>Open Flare</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The gas flares market includes two primary types: enclosed flares and open flares. Enclosed flares are designed to minimize emissions by containing combustion within a structure, making them suitable for environments with strict regulations. They typically offer higher efficiency and better control over emissions. On the other hand, open flares burn gas openly in the atmosphere, allowing for straightforward operation and lower initial costs but often resulting in higher emissions. Each type caters to different operational and environmental needs in gas production.</p></p>
