<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Addolcitore Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Salt Based</li><li>Salt Free</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The water softener market is primarily divided into two types: salt-based and salt-free systems. Salt-based softeners use sodium chloride to remove hard minerals like calcium and magnesium from water, effectively preventing scale buildup and enhancing soap efficacy. In contrast, salt-free systems utilize alternative technologies, such as Template Assisted Crystallization (TAC) or magnetic fields, to modify mineral structure, preventing scale formation without adding salt. Each type serves different needs, with salt-based systems often preferred for severe hardness, while salt-free options are ideal for those seeking low-sodium solutions.</p></p>
